/**
 * @fileoverview Technique difficulty levels — the single source of truth.
 *
 * A puzzle's 1-12 display level is owned **here**, not by the solver. The
 * solver still reports a `level` on /validate, /generate and /solve, but this
 * API ignores it and re-derives the value from {@link TECHNIQUE_LEVELS} before
 * responding, so consumers see one consistent level system no matter which
 * solver build answered. Changing a technique's level is a one-line edit in
 * this file plus a board backfill; nothing needs to ship in the solver.
 *
 * The rules:
 *
 * - **A technique's level** is {@link levelForTechnique}.
 * - **A board's level** is the level of the hardest technique its solve needed,
 *   i.e. the max over the techniques bitmask ({@link levelForBitmask}).
 * - **A hint's level** is the level of the technique that hint demonstrates.
 *
 * Levels 1-3 are set by hand: Full House is 1, Naked/Hidden Single are 2,
 * Naked/Hidden Pair are 3. Locked Candidates and Unique Rectangle Type 1 score
 * 13 in the solver, just above the pairs, and open level 4. Levels 4-12 are
 * banded by score so boards per level come out as even as the data allows;
 * re-derive the bands from the boards' techniques bitmasks (hardest technique
 * per board) if the board mix changes a lot.
 *
 * `score` is the solver's `GetDifficultyScore` (SudokuEngine/CSudokuRuleSolver.cpp,
 * documented in sudojo_solver/docs/LEVELS.md): an open-ended ratio scale anchored
 * at Full House = 1. It is mirrored here for one reason — the solver tries
 * techniques in ascending score order, so for "try easiest first" and "level"
 * to agree, `level` must be a non-decreasing banding of `score`. levels.test.ts
 * enforces it and fails if an edit breaks it.
 *
 * Keep this table in sync with the `techniques.level` column, the denormalised
 * copy the apps read to group the technique library by level:
 *   bun run scripts/verify-technique-levels.ts         # report drift
 *   bun run scripts/verify-technique-levels.ts --fix   # rewrite it from this map
 * Then re-run scripts/backfill-board-difficulty.ts, because moving a technique
 * changes the level of every board whose hardest technique it is.
